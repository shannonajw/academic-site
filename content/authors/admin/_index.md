I am currently Assistant Professor of Sociology and Deputy Director of the Centre for the Study of Social Inequality, at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. I use primarily quantitative methods to pursue my research interests, which are located at the intersection of social connectedness and societal change. For instance, I am interested in how social connections and/or social relationships (e.g., social participation, social support, social capital, etc.) shape the well-being of individuals, such as their physical and mental health. Further, I explore how these social connections and their associations with well-being change over time (e.g., age-period-cohort patterns). Findings from these studies have been published in academic journals such as *Social Science and Medicine*, *Demography*, *American Journal of Epidemiology*, *Journals of Gerontology Series B: Psychological and Social Sciences*, and *Journal of Marriage and Family* amongst others. I was trained at the University of Michigan, where I graduated with a PhD in Sociology and a MA in Statistics. I am actively seeking opportunities to engage in collaborative research projects.
