I am currently Assistant Professor of Sociology at Nanyang Technological University. I use primarily quantitative methods to pursue my research interests in life course sociology, with a focus on the health and social lives of older adults. So far, I have studied the social support and social participation (including online participation) of older adults, and their implications for mental and physical health outcomes. I have also examined population trends in union formation (e.g., marriage, cohabitation) and its effects on health outcomes. Findings from these studies have been published in academic journals such as *Social Science and Medicine*, *Demography*, *American Journal of Epidemiology*, and *Journals of Gerontology Series B: Psychological and Social Sciences*, amongst others. I was trained at the University of Michigan, where I received my PhD in Sociology and a MA in Statistics. I am actively seeking opportunities to engage in collaborative research projects.
