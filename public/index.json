The onset of pain may set off a downward spiral where lowered social participation increases the risk of depression and vice versa. This study thus assesses whether online social participation (i.e., the use of online social network sites) moderates the effect of pain on depression, possibly functioning as a compensatory mechanism for reduced offline social participation for those in pain. **Method:** Logistic regression models with a lagged dependent variable were used with panel data from the National Health and Aging Trends Study. An interaction term was included to assess the moderating effect of online social participation. **Results:** We find that online social participation buffers the detrimental effect of pain on depression. However, the effect of pain on online social participation was not statistically significant. **Discussion:** Findings show that online social participation can alleviate the negative effects of pain on mental well-being, and suggest that online social participation can supplement attempts to maintain offline social participation in later life, especially for those whose social activity may be limited by pain.","tags":[],"title":"Going online to stay connected: Online social participation buffers the relationship between pain and depression","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lois Verbrugge","**Shannon Ang**"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1536724800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1536724800,"objectID":"7dc66ca3e3854c35b3a9e24e8b453646","permalink":"/publication/eja-reciprocity/","publishdate":"2018-09-12T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/eja-reciprocity/","section":"publication","summary":"Reciprocity is a powerful motivation in social life. We study what older people give to their family for help received. Data are from the Panel on Health and Aging of Singaporean Elderly, Wave 2 (2011; persons aged 62+; N = 3103). Giving and receiving help are with family members other than spouse in the same household, in the past year. Types of help given and received are money, food/clothes/other material goods, housework/cooking, babysitting grandchildren, emotional support/advice, help for personal care, and help for going out. Multivariate models predict each type of giving help, with independent variables about the older person’s resources, needs, and help received. Reciprocity is demonstrated by positive relationships between receiving and giving help. Results show two kinds of reciprocity: “nontangibles for tangibles” and “same for same.” First, older people give their time and effort in return for money and material goods. This aligns with contemporary Singapore circumstances, in that older people tend to have ample time but limited financial resources, while family members (often midlife children) have the reverse. Second, same-for-same exchanges, such as housework both given and received, are shared tasks in families or normative behaviors in Singapore society. The results replicate and extend prior ones for Singapore. We discuss prospects for change in frequency and shape of family reciprocity as the state continues to modernize.","tags":[],"title":"Family Reciprocity of Older Singaporeans","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" In this tutorial, I\u0026rsquo;ll share my top 10 tips for getting started with Academic:\nTip 1 \u0026hellip;\nTip 2 \u0026hellip;\n","date":1536465600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1536465600,"objectID":"6a451186c775f5f0adb3a0416d0cb711","permalink":"/tutorial/example/","publishdate":"2018-09-09T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/tutorial/example/","section":"tutorial","summary":"In this tutorial, I\u0026rsquo;ll share my top 10 tips for getting started with Academic:\nTip 1 \u0026hellip;\nTip 2 \u0026hellip;","tags":null,"title":"Example Page","type":"docs"},{"authors":["**Shannon Ang**"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1527825600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1527825600,"objectID":"66e2909df45a75a828dded7f96d38f95","permalink":"/publication/ssm-sp-lifecourse/","publishdate":"2018-06-01T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/ssm-sp-lifecourse/","section":"publication","summary":"**Rationale:** Studies have consistently found positive associations between social participation and health, but it is unclear if they vary across the life course. Younger individuals are likely to initiate and benefit from social participation in different ways from older individuals, which may in turn alter its overall influence on health outcomes. Age-varying associations, if present, may then attenuate or amplify the health consequences stemming from changes in social participation over the adult life course. **Objective:** To assess the strength of the association between social participation and health across the life course, and whether it increases with age. **Methods:** I use five waves of panel data (N=11202 person-year observations) from the Americans’ Changing Lives Survey, collected over 25 years (1986–2011), to examine the association of formal and informal social participation with (1) the number of chronic health conditions and (2) depressive symptoms, focusing on whether these associations become stronger with age. Growth curve models (stratified by gender) with an accelerated longitudinal design were used to construct age trajectories of the dependent variables. An interaction term was then included to test for age-varying effects for each health outcome. **Results:** Results show that the association between formal social participation and depressive symptoms grew stronger with age, but only for men. For women, positive associations between social participation and health were found, but seemed to remain consistent over the life course. **Conclusion:** Findings suggest that the social participation and health association over the life course is likely to be contingent on gender, the type of social participation, and the specific health outcome being considered.","tags":[],"title":"Social participation and health over the adult life course: Does the association strengthen with age?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Shannon Ang**"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1520827200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1520827200,"objectID":"9199708ee9bd2ef9bd1a46649bcd60d9","permalink":"/publication/jah-sp-sma/","publishdate":"2018-03-12T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/jah-sp-sma/","section":"publication","summary":"**Objective:** Few studies have tested the purported causal mechanisms between social participation and health, especially among those in poor health.

A subsample of 662 dyads, each comprising an older care-recipient [home-dwelling Singaporean aged 75 and older receiving human assistance for at least one activity of daily living (ADL)] and his/her working family caregiver, was analysed. Caregiver depressive symptoms were assessed using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale. Care-related work interruptions were scaled through the Mokken scaling procedure. Expressive social support was assessed using a scale by Pearlin and co-workers. Instrumental social support was based on the hours of ADL help provided to the care-recipient by any family member or friend, on behalf of the primary caregiver. A linear regression model, with interaction terms, assessed expressive and instrumental social support as moderators of the association of care-related work interruptions with caregiver depressive symptoms. **Results:** More care-related work interruptions were associated with more caregiver depressive symptoms. And, this association was moderated by expressive, but not instrumental, social support. **Conclusion:** Our findings conform to previous qualitative work suggesting that caregivers’ mental health may not benefit from instrumental support, but from receiving expressive support instead. Initiatives for improving the care experience of working caregivers of older adults should focus on promoting expressive support from their friends and family.","tags":[],"title":"Expressive social support buffers the impact of care-related work interruptions on caregivers’ depressive symptoms","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"Click on the Slides button above to view the built-in slides feature.\n Slides can be added in a few ways:\n Create slides using Academic\u0026rsquo;s Slides feature and link using url_slides parameter in the front matter of the talk file Upload an existing slide deck to static/ and link using url_slides parameter in the front matter of the talk file Embed your slides (e.g. Google Slides) or presentation video on this page using shortcodes.

Elderly characteristics known to affect HGS, including age, sex, hand dominance, height, weight, occupation, education, and ethnicity, were also assessed. **Results:** We present single-year age, sex-, and hand-specific graphs for normative values (5th, 20th, and 50th percentiles) of HGS. The influence of specific elderly characteristics on the normative values of HGS varies by sex, hand, and considered percentile.

The present study investigates if ethnicity accounts for gender differences in (a) the types of social activities older adults participate in and (b) the association between social participation and 4-year mortality. **Methods:** Data from 4,482 Singaporean older adults who participated in a nationally representative longitudinal survey were analyzed. Stepwise logistic regressions and Cox proportional hazard models with inverse probability of treatment weights were used. **Results:** Men were more likely to engage in social activities compared with women, but this gender difference varied by ethnicity for three activities. Whereas going out to eat was associated with a lower risk of mortality for men only, playing sports was found to be protective for women only, but these associations did not vary by ethnicity. **Discussion:** Findings suggest that although ethnicity may account for gender differences in the content of social activity participation, it does not explain gender differences in the association between social participation and mortality. More consideration should be given to whether each activity provides an appropriate milieu for the social interaction of each gender.","tags":[],"title":"Social participation and mortality among older adults in Singapore: Does ethnicity explain gender differences?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Rahul Malhotra","**Shannon Ang**"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1462075200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1462075200,"objectID":"7b1d361ec939f15660db5a620b87f5f3","permalink":"/publication/annals-sing-ss/","publishdate":"2016-05-01T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/annals-sing-ss/","section":"publication","summary":".","tags":[],"title":"Social Support for Older Adults – A Bane or a Boon for their Health?","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1461729600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461729600,"objectID":"d1311ddf745551c9e117aa4bb7e28516","permalink":"/project/external-project/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/project/external-project/","section":"project","summary":"An example of linking directly to an external project website using `external_link`.","tags":["Demo"],"title":"External Project","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

Less is known about its role in the context of received social support. While there is some evidence that received social support may improve one's sense of personal mastery, other studies highlight that received social support may induce dependence and lower one's sense of personal mastery. In addition, less is known about structural factors such as gender that may alter this relationship. **Objective:** To examine gender differences in how personal mastery mediates the relationship between received social support and depressive symptoms. **Methods:** Using data from a nationally representative study of community dwelling older adults in Singapore, we test the hypothesis that personal mastery is an inconsistent mediator of the received social support-depressive symptoms association using mediation analysis and that gender is associated with this inconsistent mediation. **Results:** We find support for our hypothesis of personal mastery as an inconsistent mediator, and observe both the direct and indirect effects of received social support on depressive symptoms to be stronger in females than in males. **Conclusion:** Depressive symptoms for females may be more sensitive to received social support than males, which may be due to gendered pathways and expectations of support. This study highlights the need to further examine both the beneficial and detrimental effects of received social support on psychological health in tandem, considering the effect of mediating variables such as personal mastery to understand its nuanced pathways.","tags":[],"title":"Association of received social support with depressive symptoms among older males and females in Singapore: Is personal mastery an inconsistent mediator?","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":["R"],"content":"R Markdown This is an R Markdown document.
